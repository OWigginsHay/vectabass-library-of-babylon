Recently I have been enjoying Book of Ceremonial Magic by A. E. Waite 

It provides a road map for those interested in magic and the esoteric or occult. It lays out descriptions of the various famous grimoires and their contents in one place. It's strikes a balance between informative and broad without being overbearing or boring. The English is quite old which can make it hard to understand fully sometimes, but all in all it is a great intro book. Its a good 8
